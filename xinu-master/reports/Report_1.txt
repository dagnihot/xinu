What are Orphan and Zombie processes?

A process is classified as an orphan process when its parent processes cease to exist.
A process is classified as a zombie process when a parent process does not use the wait system call after a child dies to read its exit status



What are the changes that occur when the child process calls the exec system call to execute a new program?

Step 1: A new process id is created for the process. 
Step 3: fork() is called to make a copy of the process. 
Step 4: exec() is called and replaces an address space with a new program that has a process id so that new data can continue to be processed.
